In this project, you are against a computer in a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. The rules are very simple.
##
The only choices you have are obviously rock, paper, and scissors.
##
Rock beats Scissors. Paper beats rock. Scissors beat paper.
##
If the choices are the same, then it's a tie.
##
Only one side can earn a point based on the options.
